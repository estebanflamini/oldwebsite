This repository contains (almost the totality of) an old website which I developed once to publicize my translation 
services.

I put these files here just to show some of my experience with PHP, HTML, CSS, XML and javascript to potential 
employers.

Please note that the code here is probably not wholly functional, as some files needed to run it might have been 
deleted.
